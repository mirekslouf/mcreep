MCREEP
------

MCREEP package fits various pre-defined models to creep data.

The package can process both tensile and indentation creep measuremenents <br>
in such a way that the results from the two methods are comparable.

* The creep data:
    - A text file with two columns.
    - The 1st column = time, the 2nd column = deformation.
	- Deformation = strain (for tensile) or penetration depth (for indentation).
* The pre-defined models within the pagkage are:
    - Simple empirical models = Power law, Nutting's law.
    - Phenomenological models = elasto-visco-plastic models = EVP models.
* The theory and models are described in the open-acces publication:
	- Materials 16 (2023) 834.
	  [https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16020834](https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16020834)
	- If you use MCREEP in your research, **please cite** the publication above.

Quick start
-----------
1. Install MCREEP: `pip install mcreep`
2. Download the [demo package](https://mirekslouf.github.io/mcreep/docs),
   unzip it, and follow the instructions in *readme* file.
3. Basically, you just run the unzipped PY-script and see the results.
	- The PY-script should run anywhere, but the recommended environment is
      [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org).
	- The output (in Spyder) should look like in this 
      [PrintScreen](https://mirekslouf.github.io/mcreep/docs/images/mcreep_printscreen.png).
