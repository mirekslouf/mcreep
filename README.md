MCREEP :: fitting of models to creep data
-----------------------------------------

MCREEP fits various pre-defined models to creep data.

* The creep data:
    - A text file with two columns.
    - The 1st column = time, the 2nd column = deformation.
	- The package can process both tensile and indentation creep data.
* The pre-defined models within the pagkage are:
    - Simple empirical models (Power law, Nutting's law)
    - Phenomenological models = elasto-visco-plastic models = EVP models
* The MCREEP package is described in the following open-acces publication:
	- *Materials*, submitted (minor revisions requested).
	- If you use MCREEP in your research, please cite the publication above.

Quick start
-----------
1. Install MCREEP: `pip install mcreep`
2. Download the [demo package](https://mirekslouf.github.io/mcreep/docs),
   unzip it, and follow the instructions in *readme* file.
3. Basically, you just run the unzipped PY-script and see the results.
	- The PY-script should run anywhere, but the recommended environment is
      [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org).
	- The output (in Spyder) should look like in this
